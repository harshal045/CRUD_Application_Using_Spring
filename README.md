Technologies Used:

Spring MVC: Utilized the Spring MVC framework to build a scalable and maintainable web application architecture, ensuring smooth request handling and response generation.

Hibernate: Integrated Hibernate ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for seamless data persistence, abstracting away the complexities of SQL queries and database interactions.

MySQL: Leveraged MySQL as the underlying relational database management system to store and manage product data efficiently.

Maven: Employed Maven as the build tool for the project, facilitating dependency management, project configuration, and build automation.
